## About This Game:

**Family is where life begins, and love never ends.**

Follow the steps of Mark, our renamable MC, when he returns from college to help convert the house where he grew up into a female dorm for the nearby university. Rekindle with the family of choice (no one is related to him in this game) and old friends. Meet new people and discover why his father abandoned the family. Uncover a plot that involves the company founded by his uncles, a bit of spying, and a little sci-fi.

Embark in a wholesome story about how bonds are built, with a lot of fleshed-out girls from different places, with varied looks, personalities, ethnicity, and age groups. Every girl is waiting for you to discover her unique story in a game where everyone has flaws, but everyone is perfect because of them.

Our MC is a different kind of Alpha-male. He has flaws. He loses fights but wins wars. His goal is to make the people he loves happy, and sometimes he does it through love and other times through his wits, or even through violence when there isn’t another way. But he always supports his family of choice, and he never lies.

## Story and Choices:

Everything is optional in *My Dorm*. You can build a huge harem, a small one, or be monogamous with a single girl. Also, you can even choose the celibacy path. You will choose which girls you pursue and, in some cases, when you pursue them, you can even choose to break up with them. The harem is important. The family of choice is even more important.

In some cases, you can even choose physical changes for a couple of the girls.

Your choices matter, and the game reacts to them.

*My Dorm* isn’t just your catch-them-all game. You can play the catch-them-all or the catch-none-of-them game. It’s your choice. But you will discover each girl’s story along the way, with emotional moments and wholesome stories. Watch how the family of choice starts forming for everyone, how it evolves, and how it changes every one of the girls.

But you aren’t omnipotent. The girls will take action if you don’t. The ladies, sometimes, will do things you haven’t asked for. They are alive, and they have their own agenda.
